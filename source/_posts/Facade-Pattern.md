### Facade  外观模式/门面模式

##### 作用

- The intent of the Facade is to provide a high-level interface (properties and methods) that makes a subsystem or toolkit easy to use for the client. 

  统一入口，简化调用

- The Facade exposes only what is necessary and presents a cleaner and easy-to-use interface. 

  降低依赖，松耦合

##### 应用场景

- It is often present in systems that are built around a multi-layer architecture. 
- Facades themselves are often implemented as singleton factories.
